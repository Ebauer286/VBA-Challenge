# VBA-Challenge
I completed the Module 2 Challenge VBA Script with the assistance of Xpert and AskBCS learning.
I heavily relied on Xpert to assist me with troubleshooting of the code. I ran my full code script multiple times through Xpert as this is my first time using/learning VBA and am still learning the general foundations of how to set up the code structure. A lot of my stuff was out of order so Xpert helped me troubleshoot and provide a guideline of the structure of the code.
I did attend office hours almost every day before class for clarification questions/assistance and to talk through the general questions of the module homework. 
Noah on AskBCS helped me with a guideline of how to start setting up the code structure. See screenshot "AskBCS - Noah"
Brandon on AskBCS also assisted me with clarification questions in regard to the nested Ticker. I had actually coded it correctly but thought it was incorrect but after reviewing it with Brandon he confirmed it was set up properly.
